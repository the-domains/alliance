## **Andy Mayhew -- Media
Director & Strategist**

Andy
Mayhew is Alliance Media's Media Director and one of Whangarei's most
experienced marketing consultants.  Andy has a unique approach when it
comes to marketing, based on many years in the marketing and advertising
industry.

Andy
Mayhew began his career in retail over 20 years ago for Lion Nathan, becoming
the youngest manager in the country at 23\.  His Wairoa SuperLiquor store
became one of the most profitable of its size in New Zealand.  Andy
progressively managed larger stores over seven years.

Andy
went on to open and manage a franchise Wakefield's appliance store before
moving to Whangarei to manage a Levene's store for three years, during which
time it grew to become one of the top rated stores in the country known for
large profits, high morale and low staff turnover.

Andy
moved into marketing with the national demise of Levene & Co. growing his
sales base at Radio Network by over 300%.  He became the top salesperson
in Northland, winning the prestigious 'CEO' award after five years.

CanWest/RadioWorks
approached Andy to work for them and within six months he won the National
Award for 'client service champion' of the year.  Over a three-year period
he increased his sales base by over 300% and was awarded membership in the exclusive
'million dollar club' for achieving sales exceeding $1 million for the company.

Andy
Mayhew formed Alliance Media because he believed Northland business owners need
top quality creative and marketing skills.  Alliance Media allows Andy to
supply an ever-greater service and more options for clients in Whangarei and
Northland-wide.
