Media is all about.We have been serving
Whangarei and Northland businesses since 2007 with specifically tailored total
marketing and advertising solutions.Keeping our clients happy and growing their businesses is what we pride
ourselves on.</p><h2>Client Testimonials</h2><p>Here’s what a few of them have to say about us…</p><p><b>Linda Wallis – Director of Assist You

</b></p><p>I have been dealing with Alliance Media for some time now
and continue to enjoy the experience. Andy is full of ideas, excitement about
my business and focuses on my needs, my personality and my business.Since we revamped my website and brochure my
business has climbed to unexpected new heights.I freely recommend Alliance Media to any business that wants to find new
directions in marketing – but don’t sit back and relax because you’re going on
a fast track to success.</p><p><b>Durwin Eagle – Previous owner of Cheapskates and Inferno</b></p><p>I own and manage a skate shop in the Strand Arcade,
Whangarei and I have been involved in retail for 5 years now. Over the past 3
years my sales have increased by nearly 40%. During that time Andy has played a
big part in the growth of my business. I felt that he has done this by taking
an active interest in the business and establishing a friendship that has made
me confident in making decisions based on his experiences from various retail
roles within Liquor sales, Levenes and The Warehouse. I have also accessed his
network of associates to get other work done within the business.</p><p><b>Grant Stone– Managing Director of Baigents Office Products
Depot</b></p><p>Alliance Media – Andy Mayhew has been working with Baigents
Office Products in Northland for 4 years now –bringing changes and a new direction for our marketing and advertising.
Andy and his team have added a degree of marketing expertise that, as a SME, we
simply did not possess in-house. They took away from us the time consuming tasks
of creating a marketing plan, negotiating media contracts, and turning words
into action. Nothing is too difficult for Andy and his team to handle when it
comes to marketing and above all else the services he provides are efficient
and very cost effective.</p><p><b>Steve Clarke – Co-Director of Autocare and Owens Brakes
& Suspension</b></p><p>Andy Mayhew has been dealing with Autocare both as a
Customer and an Advertising representative for in excess of ten years now. In
that time we have always found Andy to be an honest and open person. Since
starting Alliance Media, Andy has been of immense help with our advertising
schedule, both the writing of any advertising material and the full production
of our Quarterly Newsletter. We have on numerous occasions made use of Alliance
Media’s expertise in deciding which medium to use and the best value for money
options available, they are always prompt in answering any queries. We would
have no hesitation to promote Alliance Media to anyone considering their own
advertising schedule.</p><p><b>G.R Wilkinson – Manager/Owner Renovation Warehouse (formerly
Demolition Supermarket)</b></p><p>We are a new and used building supply firm based in
Whangarei. We have been using the services of Alliance Media for approximately
two years, in the areas of marketing and business development. This is the
second such firm we have used in the last five years. On a personal level:
Alliance Media are a progressive, innovative firm, easy to deal with and have
good communicative skills. In terms of benefit to our business: I believe there
have been distinct advantages starting from outsourcing of key skills, time
management, integration of our marketing with our advertising budgets and in
taking a more cohesive approach to the way in which we do things. It has
certainly freed up time that otherwise I would have had to have had some input
in myself. I believe Alliance Media have had a direct input into the efficiency
and profitability of our business.</p><p><b>Graeme Johnson – Owner Graeme Johnson Jewels and Time</b></p><p>I have known Andy Mayhew in a business capacity
approximately 10 years. Over this period Andy has been our Advertising
Consultant, dealing with the radio campaigns we have run. Andy’s enthusiasm and
belief in our company is unequalled and has been of real benefit to my
business. He took time to build up a relationship, often recommending ideas and
concepts outside my own personal comfort zone. Andy has always been well
groomed, very professional and polite, and willing to go the extra mile. In my
personal observation he appeared to handle pressure well, sometimes under
trying circumstances and time limitations. There is no hesitation to recommend
Andy to any future employer.</p><p><b>Bill Huddleston – Huddleston Hypnotherapy</b></p><p>My business has grown significantly to the extent that I am
only one of three full-time practicing hypnotherapists in provincial New
Zealand. Radio advertising has been a major factor in this growth. Throughout
this time Andy has been a superb rep. He has maintained regular contact,
checking to make sure things are still working well. He has always given
excellent advice, obviously understanding how to match the potential of the
radio advertising medium to the specific needs of my business. He has been able
to incorporate my ideas into very workable solutions. Andy has the ability to
combine being able to build excellent personal relationships with providing a
quality professional service. I recommend Andy as a person who will give you
110%</p><p><b>Ron Mason – Northland Kenpo Karate</b></p><p>Northland Kenpo Karate would like to endorse the business of
Alliance Media. We found our point of contact with that business to be
efficient, friendly, courteous and always mindful of what we wanted for our
website.Having the website up and
running in the style designed by Alliance Media has given Northland Kenpo
untold international and local coverage.</p><p><b>Murray Tonks – Murray Tonks Panelbeaters</b></p><p>We have dealt with Alliance Media over many years and have
always found them to be very professional in their dealings, obliging and able
to listen to our needs and put them into action. The benefits to our business
have been incredible. Our profile in the industry can be put down to the
efforts made by the Alliance Media team and their marketing skills are first
class.</p><p><b>Wayne Stead – Executive Officer of Northland Business
Development Trust (retired)</b></p><p>The team at the Northland Business Development Trust have
had a very successful working relationship with Andy Mayhew and his competent
website and marketing team at Alliance Media for several years and the
experience has been both rewarding and productive for us . Andy has a vast
management and marketing background which he uses to give realistic and sound
advice to his clients thus ensuring that they receive great value for money .
The most important factor for me is the energy and effort which is put into
maximising and optimising client’s websites so that it is not only seen to be
working effectively but constantly in the upper levels of the Google index
ensuring best exposure. The work is done in a timely way and is very cost
effective. We are enjoying our ongoing relationship with Alliance Media and their
competent team and will continue to work with them in the future.</p><p><b>Grant McLeod – CEO of Northland Hockey Association</b></p><p>Alliance Media (Andy Mayhew) and NHA have worked closely
together over the past 5 years to build up our sponsorship portfolio. We have
had a significant increase in the number of sponsors but more importantly the
100% re signing rate for existing sponsors. This is due in no small part to the
relationship that Andy has developed with the sponsors along with the added
value offers we have given the sponsors. Andy has been open to new ideas and
created new ones that have enhanced the sponsorship relationships. The ability
of Alliance Media to deliver a “total package” has been of great value. We look
to continuing our relationship with Alliance Media into the future</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="32"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="34"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="35"><span data-reactid="36"><!-- react-empty: 37 --><h2 data-reactid="38"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="39">Client Testimonials</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="40"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="41"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="42"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
